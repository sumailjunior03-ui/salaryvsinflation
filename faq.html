                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What does this tool calculate?</h3>
                <p>
                    It calculates whether your salary raise keeps up with
                    inflation. A raise that sounds good may not increase your
                    actual purchasing power if inflation is higher.
                </p>

                <h3>What is real purchasing power?</h3>
                <p>
                    Purchasing power is what your money can actually buy. If
                    your salary goes up 3% but inflation is 5%, you can afford
                    less than before even though your paycheck is bigger.
                </p>

                <h3>How is the result calculated?</h3>
                <p>
                    The tool applies your raise percentage to your current
                    salary to get your new salary, then adjusts that figure for
                    inflation to find the real value. If the real value is
                    higher than your current salary, your raise beats inflation.
                </p>

                <h3>Where do I find the current inflation rate?</h3>
                <p>
                    The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes the
                    Consumer Price Index (CPI) monthly at bls.gov. You can use
                    the most recent annual CPI figure as your inflation rate.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this tool accurate?</h3>
                <p>
                    The math is deterministic and accurate based on the numbers
                    you enter. The result depends entirely on the inflation rate
                    you use — make sure you're using a current and relevant
                    figure.
                </p>

                <h3>Does this tool store my data?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. All calculations run entirely in your browser. No data
                    is sent to any server or stored anywhere.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this financial advice?</h3>
