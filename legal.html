                <h3>1. For Informational Purposes Only</h3>
                <p>
                    The Salary vs Inflation tool is provided as a general
                    informational planning tool. All results are based solely on
                    the numbers entered by the user and are not guarantees of
                    any financial outcome.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Accuracy of Results</h3>
                <p>
                    Results depend entirely on the salary, raise percentage, and
                    inflation rate entered by the user. We make no
                    representations about the accuracy of third-party inflation
                    data. Always use current, verified figures from reliable
                    sources such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                </p>

                <h3>3. No Financial Advice</h3>
